FUNCTIONALITY TODO:
- Let engine be stand alone process
- WASM (requires moving away from jthreads)
- Introduce new tab with live und data and option price and simulated option price
- Create engine process, use "named pipe" for more simple way to transfer data from engine to p1. (data needs to be copied twice)
-

PRESENTATION:
- Show bigger increment step -> bigger error.
- Show time vs cpu usage tradeoff w.r.t multithreading.
- Different solvers
