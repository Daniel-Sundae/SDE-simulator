
MATH TODO:
- Implement example 3.1.1. Can I see that using left edge Bt as weight gives 0 on average while right edge gives T? (Stratonovic vs ito)


FUNCTIONALITY TODO:
- loading symbol for simulation taking time
- Add dot showing the final result of sim in chart graph.
- Implement:
	seed
	sample
	rk/other solvers
	other processes

CODE DESIGN TODO:
- Stresstest to check if inputhandler can get into broken state
- Use valgrind
- Use sub cmakeprojects

TECH DETAILS TODO:
- use async. Transmit loading signal to OutputManager
- swap out std::function to something more performant
- use threads for many paths.
- Use threadpool to avoid spinning up threads
- Maybe use more than one thread per path (for simple paths like BM). Could write function sampleRange() andattach offset to each range, where offset is previous range's last value.

DESIGN CHOICES MADE:
- Every query is self contained, meaning chart is always cleared when doing a new sample
- There simulation is non blocking and user can cancel query
