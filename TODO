MATH TODO:
- Implement such that I can see which weights f(t,w) are being used at each time step, and each outcome, when plotting f(t,w)Bs
- Implement example 3.1.1. Can I see that using left edge Bt as weight gives 0 on average while right edge gives T? (Stratonovic vs ito)
- Add solver types


FUNCTIONALITY TODO:
- sample many times without removing plots + Clear button
- loading symbol for simulation taking time
- add dashed red driftline. Should be present immediately.
- Add dot showing the final result of sim in chart graph.

CODE DESIGN TODO:
- remove "listener" term. Nothing is actually listening. Only change after done with architecture so that i can insert object and stuff.
- send activetype from mainpresenter immediately to outputhandler. Outputhandler generates loadingsymbol while waiting for path(s)
- Check if possible to trigger all eventr in inputmanager so that the information can be sent to inputhandler to "reset" or initialize it, in case the state is broken somehow.

TECH DETAILS TODO:
- Make sure old data is not leaking. Either outputmanager deletes or data saved to disc
- use async. Transmit loading signal to chartmanager
- use threads for many paths.
- Use threadpool to avoid spinning up threads
- Maybe use more than one thread per path (for simple paths like BM). Could write function sampleRange() andattach offset to each range, where offset is previous range's last value.
