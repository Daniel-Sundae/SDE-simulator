
MATH TODO:
- Implement example 3.1.1. Can I see that using left edge Bt as weight gives 0 on average while right edge gives T? (Stratonovic vs ito)


FUNCTIONALITY TODO:
- loading symbol for simulation taking time
- Add dot showing the final result of sim in chart graph.
- Implement:
	seed
	sample
	rk/other solvers
	other processes

CODE DESIGN TODO:
- Stresstest to check if inputhandler can get into broken state
- Use valgrind
- Use sub cmakeprojects

TECH DETAILS TODO:
- use async. Transmit loading signal to OutputDispatcher
- swap out std::function to something more performant
- move std::function into taskqueue instead of copying it
- use condition variable isntead of busy waiting for threads
- do non blocking instead of gathering the futures immediately
- Remove copying and instead move ownership of PathQuery from inputhandler to PathEngine. (Maybe forwarding?)

DESIGN CHOICES MADE:
- Every query is self contained, meaning chart is always cleared when doing a new sample
- There simulation is non blocking and user can cancel query

ERRORS
GBM, no randomness, 0.01 diffusion.
