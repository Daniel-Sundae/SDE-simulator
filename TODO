
MATH TODO:
- Implement example 3.1.1. Can I see that using left edge Bt as weight gives 0 on average while right edge gives T? (Stratonovic vs ito)

FUNCTIONALITY TODO:
- set drifline on top
- Implement:
	seed and multithread options
	rk/other solvers
	other processes
- tooltips not working
- switch useseed to std::optional<uint32_t>
- can't have threadlocal generator if seed should be dynamic. Make sure seed works. Test it
- make sure singe thread works. Test it.
