- Implement such that I can see which weights f(t,w) are being used at each time step, and each outcome, when plotting f(t,w)Bs
- Implement example 3.1.1. Can I see that using left edge Bt as weight gives 0 on average while right edge gives T? (Stratonovic vs ito)

- sample many times without removing plots. Clear button
- use async. Transmit loading signal to chartmanager
- use threads for many paths.
- Maybe use more than one thread per path (for simple paths like BM). Could write function sampleRange() andattach offset to each range, where offset is previous range's last value.
- Use threadpool to avoid spinning up threads
- Make sure old data deleted after presented when pressing button again.
