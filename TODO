
MATH TODO:
- Implement example 3.1.1. Can I see that using left edge Bt as weight gives 0 on average while right edge gives T? (Stratonovic vs ito)

FUNCTIONALITY TODO:
- set drifline on top
- Implement:
	seed and multithread options
	rk/other solvers
	other processes
- switch useseed to std::optional<uint32_t>
- can't have threadlocal generator if seed should be dynamic. Make sure seed works. Test it
- make sure singe thread works. Test it.
- make sure that if we are checking to use seed in db, that it is thread safe. All threads are currently reading from same std::pair.

CODE DESIGN TODO:

TECH DETAILS TODO:
- swap out std::function to something more performant

DESIGN CHOICES MADE:

ERRORS
- GBM, no randomness, 0.01 diffusion.
- tooltips not working
