MATH TODO:
- Implement such that I can see which weights f(t,w) are being used at each time step, and each outcome, when plotting f(t,w)Bs
- Implement example 3.1.1. Can I see that using left edge Bt as weight gives 0 on average while right edge gives T? (Stratonovic vs ito)
- Add solver types


FUNCTIONALITY TODO:
- sample many times without removing plots + Clear button

CODE DESIGN TODO:
- remove "listener" term. Nothing is actually listening. Only change after done with architecture so that i can insert object and stuff.

TECH DETAILS TODO:
- Make sure old data is not leaking. Either outputmanager deletes or data saved to disc
- use async. Transmit loading signal to chartmanager
- use threads for many paths.
- Use threadpool to avoid spinning up threads
- Maybe use more than one thread per path (for simple paths like BM). Could write function sampleRange() andattach offset to each range, where offset is previous range's last value.
